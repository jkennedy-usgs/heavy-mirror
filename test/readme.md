Three previously published example models are provided with Heavy.

## All American Canal

A single-layer MODFLOW-NWT model (Wildermuth and Kennedy, 2022) of the All American Canal in southeast California, USA, simulates the dissipation of a groundwater mound following the concrete-lining of the Canal to reduce seepage losses (Kennedy and others, 2021). This model was used to demonstrate model calibration with a field repeat microgravity dataset (U.S. Geological Survey, 2021).

## Rio Grande Valley (Albuquerque, NM)

A multilayer MODFLOW-2005 model for the Rio Grande Valley near Albuquerque, New Mexico demonstrates layer property flow and complex use of zones and arrays (Meyers and Friesz, 2019).

## Truxton basin, northwest Arizona

A 4-layer MODFLOW-NWT model (Knight, 2020a) from northwest Arizona demonstrates upstream weighting and unconfined storage in multiple layers. Storage changes in this model occur in response to groundwater pumping (Knight, 2020b); the complex pattern of predicted gravity change (Figure below) reflects the distribution of storage properties in the groundwater model, which were based on a detailed airborne electromagnetic survey (Ball et al., 2019).
